# Datascience Syllabus

## Introduction
Datascience as a subject spans over various aspects of learning. However i have tried to narrow down and tried to give a focused path or a curriculum for new learners.

Very broadly i was able to classify the datascience learning into four broad categories
1. Maths behind the datascience
2. Programming and supporting libraries
3. Process of machine learning and Commonly used algorithms
4. Build your own algorithms

Each of the categories above has plenty of learning materials available on the internet in the form of blogs, books, tutorials, videos , college courses , github repo's, data repos, programming libraries etc. They comprise both paid and free verisons available for us to use.

I'm coming from a programming background. I don't know how i cleared my undergraduate mathematics exams in college, because today, i dont remember even the smallest thing that i learnt in calculus or linear algebra. Depending on our learning readiness, each of the above categories has beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of the courses available online. In some of the materials and the links that are available below, i have tried to tag the learner levels.

I have made several failed attempts at mastering some of the mathematics concepts before and i have always given up halfway because theory is boring. I think we need to strike a balance between the mathematics theory and the practical application of them. 

Since i'm from a programming background, i feel writing some bit of code inbetween learning mathematical concepts helps. This time i'm going to give it a hybrid approach where weekly couple of days i focus on mathematical concepts and couple of days are filled with programming tutorials and exercises. I'm hoping this might help me to stay put and finish the trainigs.


## Maths Behind the Datascience

Below are the list of topics that you will need to cover to get a grasp on the mathematical concepts behind the datascience algorithms
