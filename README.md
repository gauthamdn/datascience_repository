# Datascience Syllabus

# Introduction
Datascience as a subject spans over various aspects of learning. However i have tried to narrow down and give a focused path or a curriculum for new learners.

Very broadly i was able to classify the datascience learning into four broad categories
1. Maths behind the datascience
2. Programming and supported libraries
3. Process of machine learning and Commonly used algorithms
4. Build your own algorithms

Each of the categories above has plenty of learning materials available on the internet in the form of blogs, books, tutorials, videos , college courses , github repo's, data repos etc. They comprise both paid and free versions available for us to use.

I'm coming from a programming background. I don't remember even the smallest thing that i learnt in calculus or linear algebra in my college. Depending on our learning readiness, i have tried to categorize the courses into beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.. In some of the materials and the links that are available below, i have tried to tag the learner levels.

I have made several failed attempts at mastering some of the mathematics concepts before and i have always given up halfway because theory is boring. I think we need to strike a balance between the mathematics theory and the practical application of them.

Since i'm from a programming background, i feel writing some bit of code inbetween learning mathematical concepts helps. This time i'm going to give it a hybrid approach where weekly couple of days i focus on mathematical concepts and couple of days are filled with programming tutorials and exercises. I'm hoping this might help me to stay put and finish the trainigs.


# 1. Maths behind the Datascience

Below are the list of topics that you will need to cover to get a grasp on the mathematical concepts behind the datascience algorithms

## 1.1 Calculus
### Beginner level course
Below are Khan-academy courses for beginners
* [Pre-calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus)
* [Differential calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)
* [Integral calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus)
* [Mutlivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

### Intermediate
* [Coursera : Introduction to Calculus ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-calculus/home/welcome)

## 1.2 Linear Algebra
### Beginner level course
Below are Khan-academy courses for beginners. It introduces us to linear equations, logarithms, matrices,
* [Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics)
* [Linear Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
### Advanced level course
Below is a lectures videos from Gilbert Strang
* [MIT: Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/)


## 1.3 Statistics & Probability
### Beginner level course
Beginner course from Khan Academy which gives us a overview of Mean, Medium, standard deviations, Histograms
* [Statistics & Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

# 2. Programming and supported libraries

## 2.1 Python Programming
These ones are for starters for python. They take you through the basics of python and not really into Datascience.
But if you are a newbie, i would prefer you play around with programming on python using below resources
### Beginner level course
* [Kaggle-Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
* [Google Developers - Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)

The below course will include lot more packages that are needed to do Datascience.
### Medium level course
* [Datacamp - datascientist with python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python#)
*

## 2.2 Jupyter Notebook
The below course will include lot more packages that are needed to do Datascience.

### 2.3 Supporting Libraries
The below course will include lot more packages that are needed to do Datascience.

#### Pandas
The below course will include lot more packages that are needed to do Datascience.
#### Numpy
The below course will include lot more packages that are needed to do Datascience.
#### Sklearn
